  <h1>Speaking at PyData PDX Meetups</h1>

  <p>
      Have you been working on an interesting project that you want to show off?
      Found a really cool library that you want everyone to know about?
      Whether it’s a half-hour slot or a 5-minute lightning talk, get in touch and let’s get you on the stage!
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s a few details to note:

    <ul>
      <li>Each meetup will have two longer talks &mdash; 30 minutes talk time (including any Q&A)</li>
      <li>There is time for two or three 5 minute lightning talks</li>
      <li>Check the NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> &mdash; all language and imagery must be inclusive (e.g. prefer something like ‘folks’ over ‘guys’)</li>
      <li>No product pitches &mdash; we’re strict about this &mdash; these aren’t sales slots and the room is not populated by buyers</li>
      <li>Your talk should educate, but you’re welcome to note "we’re hiring" or similar during your talk</li>
    </ul>

  </p>
    To submit a talk, visit the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-PDX/members/">members section of PyData PDX Meetup page</a> and get in touch via “Contact” button.
